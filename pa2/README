README
	This README file
Makefile
	Makefile for List.o, ListClient(.o), and Shuffle(.o)
List.c
	ANSI C implementation of the doubly linked list ADT
List.h
	Header for List's exported data structures and functions
ListClient.c
	Source for a test driver for the List implementation
Shuffle.c
	An application that calculates the number of card shuffles required to return
	to the initial state of a deck. Requires List.h.

Notes:
	I've implemented the optional functions cat() and makeEmpty(), and they're
	tested in the test driver in main(). My tests do not include any print
	statements, the tests are all conducted using List methods, and print error
	messages and exit if the test fails. This allows a greater degree of precision
	than I'd be able to quickly see by eye. I've probably tested more thoroughly
	than is necessary. TESTNODES in ListClient.c is used throughout testing as the
	number of nodes in the test lists to create.

	In my files, tabs are equivalent to two spaces.

	I used the following shell script for testing:
		#!/bin/sh
		make clean
		make ListClient
		./ListClient
		make Shuffle
		for int in 9 14 500 508 511
		do ./Shuffle $int; done
		echo "Desired: 6, 4, 166, 508, 9"
