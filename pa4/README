README
	This README file
Makefile
	Makefile for project
FindComponents.c
	Application to print the adjacency list and strongly connected components of a graph
Graph.c
	ANSI C implementation of a graph ADT
Graph.h
	Header for Graph's exported data structures and functions
GraphClient.c
	Test driver for Graph implementation (output to 'out_file')
List.c
	ANSI C implementation of the doubly linked list ADT
List.h
	Header for List's exported data structures and functions
ListClient.c
	Source for a test driver for the List implementation

Notes:
	Attribution: The file I/O code is directly based on the instructor's fileio.c example.
	The List files are almost directly from my pa2 assignment.  The makefile is directly
	from the pa4 handout.

	In my files, tabs are equivalent to two spaces.

	The test driver for the Graph ADT, GraphClient, uses the graph from the handout for
	it's test, the output (to "out_file") should look as follows:
-----
Adjacency list representation of G:
1: 2
2: 3 5 6
3: 4 7
4: 3 8
5: 1 6
6: 7
7: 6 8
8: 8

G contains 4 strongly connected components:
Component 1: 1 2 5
Component 2: 3 4
Component 3: 6 7
Component 4: 8
-----
	This is the same as running the FindComponents application with the input file from the
	handout:

3 4 
3 7
